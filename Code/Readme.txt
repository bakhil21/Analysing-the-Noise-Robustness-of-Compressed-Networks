1. We use the the notebook Resnet_18_baseline.ipynb to create our baseline model and train it.
2. The student models creation and training is defined in the notebook Know_Dist.ipynb
3. Pruning_Resnet18.ipynb contains the code related to unstructured and structured pruning of the baseline models to various degrees of sparsity.
4. Finally all the models robustness to noise is tested in the file Testing_Results.ipynb
